I am Soichiro Nishimori, a 1st year PhD student at [Sugiyama-Yokoya-Ishida lab](https://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) supervised by [Prof. Sugiyama](https://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html). Also I am a member of [Geoinformatics Team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/goalorient_tech/geoinf/index.html) at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/research/labs/aip/). I am into Reinforcement Learning (RL): (1) [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) based RL for full utilization of the GPU power, (2) Game AI research as a testbed for real world application, (3) Statistical RL. My hobbies include tennis, Japanese Riichi Mahjong.
